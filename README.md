Networking Sample
===================

This sample shows how can we access endpoints by these networking libraries:
1) Volley
2) Retrofit2
3) RxJava

RSS titles are retrieved from digg.com and displayed in a list.

Volley response requires GSON parsing whereas Retrofit2 and RxJava have built-in GSON parser.

Personally, Retrofit2 is the easiest to use and maintain among these three.
